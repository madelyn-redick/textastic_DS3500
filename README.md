# Textastic
This dashboard was part of a Fall 2023 homework assignment for DS3500 - Advanced Programming with Data at Northeastern University. Worked with @sahana-dhar and @payeurjeremiah to visualizing Cold War speeches based on words sentiment and cosine similarity. 

## How to Visualize
1. Clone this repository
2. cd into textastic_DS3500/textastic_framework/.
3. Run `NLProcessed_app.py`.
4. 3 Sankey diagrams will open in your browser that represent most common word sequences and most common words from each speech.
5. You will also see a cosine similarity heatmap, sentiment density plots, and sentiment KDE plots.
